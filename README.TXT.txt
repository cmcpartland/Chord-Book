The ChordBook program allows the user to identify guitar chords by choosing guitar notes on an on-screen fretboard.

System Requirements======================================================================

This program requires Python 2.7 to be installed on the computer.

Operation Instructions===================================================================

With Python 2.7 installed double-click the file labeled ChordBook.py. 

1) Select the guitar's tuning.
2) Select the notes being played on the guitar.
3) Click the 'Identify' button to identify the chord.
